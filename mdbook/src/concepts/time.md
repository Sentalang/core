# Time

A central aspect of Sentalang is its well-defined time system, which is designed to ensure consistency and precision throughout the rhythm game experience. By providing a robust time tracking mechanism, Sentalang aims to eliminate ambiguities and ensure that gimmicks or visual effects do not impact the game's timing.

For more information about Sentalang's time tracking, read the [basics](./time_basics.md) then read about [BPMs and offsets](./bpm_offset.md).
