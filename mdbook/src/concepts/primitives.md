# Primitives

The core specification of Sentalang provides two useful primitives: fractions and cubic Bézier curves.
- Fractions provide a lossless numeric type primarily used for representing time.
- Cubic Bézier curves provide an easy way to represent curves or approximate any non-linear function.
